What happens if the following program is executed in C and C++?

#include<stdio.h> 

int main() 

{ 

   foo();

}  

int foo() 

{ 

   printf("Hello"); 

   return 0;  

}

Ans :- : 
In C++ all the functions should be declared before

 it is called otherwise the C++ compiler will give an error 
 but in case of C the compiler just gives a warning and the program can be executed.
